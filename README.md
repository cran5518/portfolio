# Portfolio

## About Me:
I am Georgia Crane, a senior at the University of St. Thomas, majoring in computer science with a minor in applied Statistics. I really enjoy coding and problem solving which extends into my free time of solving escape room and watching murder mysteries. I am also an active individual, I love to rock climb and be out in nature.

## Projects:
### Dungeon Party:
Dungeon Party is a free, online multiplayer game designed for large groups to play together easily and accessibly. Unlike most team-based games that cap at four players, Dungeon Party is built to support larger groups, making it ideal for parties, classrooms, or social gatherings. It requires no specialized hardware, payments, or prior gaming experience, lowering the barrier to entry and maximizing inclusivity. This project emphasizes accessibility, teamwork, and large-scale collaboration.

As part of a group project, I contributed to both the brainstorming phase and the development of the front and back end, helping bring the game's concept to life through collaborative coding and design.

### Vet Management System:
Â The Vet Management System is a sample web application built as a group project to practice full-stack development, with a focus on database design and front-end integration. The system managed data for pet owners, pets, veterinarians, clinics, billing, and company infrastructure for scalability. Users could view data in each table and access related data via a dynamic interface, showcasing relational database functionality in a clear and user-friendly way.

We used SQLite as the database, with SQLAlchemy and Flask to integrate the Python back end with a front end built using HTML. I led the integration of the front and back end and was solely responsible for the front-end design. I also contributed to the initial project idea and helped organize the database schema.
