This semester, our capstone course required demos every sprint and a final project presentation, which gave me multiple opportunities to notice my growth in communication skills, especially public speaking. These experiences showed me how I've grown to be more confident and clear when presenting technical information. Additionally, when issues arose within my group, I found that I was better at proactively communicating with team members to resolve problems quickly. On the technical side, working with unfamiliar languages and libraries pushed me to either learn quickly or risk falling behind, which challenged me to grow my skills under pressure. Feedback from my group’s peer skill evaluations also confirmed this growth, as they highlighted my strengths in both presenting and communicating effectively. Together, these experiences demonstrate my developing balance of technical expertise and interpersonal skills.

This growth is also reflected in my portfolio, which highlights how both my communication and technical skills have developed. As someone who used to be scared of public speaking, I am proud of the work I have put in to grow and develop my communication and public speaking skills to what they are today. While this semester did include public speaking, I was glad to show off my skills. This semester also demanded a lot of communication that I hadn’t experienced in group projects like this before. It may have been due to the role I played. While I really enjoyed making this product, this wasn’t the product I wanted to make, and I didn’t have quite the image that my group members had. Due to them being the driving force for imagining this product, there was a lot of communication needed to understand how they wanted this product to come out.

Additionally, my technical skills show my growth because before this project I had not used Typescript, pixi.js, or sockets before. While I was excited for the chance to learn new skills, the learning curve was quite steep when the group wasn’t learning together, due to another group member being more experienced. This required a lot of communication to understand this and personal research to be able to apply it.

This experience also reinforced how my soft skills and adaptability support my technical learning. My technical and soft skills have consistently supported each other throughout my projects. For example, when working with technologies or programming languages unfamiliar to me, I begin by researching independently, but my communication skills are essential for learning efficiently from teammates who have more experience. This exchange helps me overcome technical hurdles faster and deepens my understanding. Additionally, my adaptability and organization have been crucial in mastering new technical skills. Being adaptable allows me to switch focus between different programming languages or tools as needed, while staying organized helps me, as a visual learner, maintain clarity in my code and project structure. Together, these soft skills create a strong foundation that enhances my technical growth and effectiveness in collaborative environments.

Alongside the development of these skills, my understanding of the role of technology in society has also deepened. My perspective on technology’s role in society has evolved significantly over the course of this semester. Previously, my experience was limited to either frontend or backend development, but this course gave me a fullstack experience, allowing me to see how these parts interact and depend on each other. During the early stages of our project, when we were brainstorming ideas, I realized that many niche problems remain unaddressed in the gaming world, especially regarding accessibility. Near the end of the semester, our team discussed the future growth opportunity of expanding the game’s features to include more customizable controls to better accommodate players with disabilities. This reflection highlighted how exclusion from certain technologies, like games, can have real social and emotional impacts on individuals. I strongly resonate with the University of St. Thomas’ mission of working towards the common good, and I believe creating accessible technology aligns perfectly with that goal by striving to make technology inclusive and beneficial for all.

This alignment between my values and my work continues to guide my development as a computer scientist. My work as a computer scientist is guided by core personal values of creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration. These values shape how I approach every project, as they keep me engaged and motivated to improve the work I do. I find that when I’m able to apply creativity and teamwork to solve problems, the project becomes more meaningful and enjoyable. Equally important to me is ensuring that my technical achievements benefit others. While the impact doesn’t have to be monumental, knowing that my work can help someone, even in a small way, gives it real purpose and significance to me. This focus on ethical and helpful technology motivates me to continually improve both my skills and the quality of my contributions.

Another important challenge that helped me grow this semester was navigating a new team dynamic where I had less influence in shaping the project vision. As I’ve mentioned, this project was very communication heavy to understand and visualize. I believe this was very challenging in the beginning for me because although I’ve worked in projects like this before, I don’t normally take on a backseat role in the visualizing part. At first, I was struggling quite a bit as to why there was a disconnect between myself and the project. Then I realized that I do like playing a part in mapping out the project, and it helps me feel connected to what I am doing. After I realized this, I understood that this was an opportunity to learn how to overcome this gap, as I’m sure I’ll encounter it in professional settings.
